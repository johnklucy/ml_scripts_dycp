# ml_scripts_dycp
for the dance film I'm making for my Develop Your Creative Practice grant project Points Of Origin. A collection of ml tools/scripts for extracting information about dancers and chaining the inputs and outputs of these processes together. For eventual use in Blender, openframeworks and Unreal Engine.
